Trefos is a service built to connect restaurants to food banks to help reduce food waste within communities. Trefos works by allowing restaurants to upload any excess foods that they have to our platform, which food banks can then view and contact the restaurant that best meets their needs.

We used React, AWS, and the Google Maps API to build this application. We used React for the frontend and AWS Amplify for the backed and domain hosting. We also used the Google Maps API to get the addresses of restaurants and display them on an interactive map through their geocoding functions.

In the end, we redistributed around 1100 pounds of food, feeding more than 850 homeless people in the Summer of 2022.
